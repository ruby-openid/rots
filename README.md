Ruby OpenID Test Server (ROTS) is a dummy OpenID server that makes consumer tests dead easy.

ROTS is a minimal implementation of an OpenID server, developed on top of the Rack middleware, this
server provides an easy to use interface to make testing OpenID consumers really easy.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add rots

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install rots

## No more mocks

Have you always wanted to test the authentication of an OpenID consumer implementation, but find your self
in a point where is to hard to mock? A lot of people have been there.

With ROTS, you only need to specify an identity url provided by the dummy server, passing with it a flag
saying that you want the authentication to be successful. It handles SREG extensions as well.

### Or do use mocks, maybe?

You can also require a library of mocks and request helpers which might be useful in your tests (perhaps in your `spec_helper.rb`):

```ruby
require "rots/mocks"
require "rots/test"

OpenID.fetcher = Rots::Mocks::Fetcher.new(Rots::Mocks::RotsServer.new)

RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.include(Rots::Test::RackTestHelpers)
end
```

Helpers are written with minitest syntax,
but RSpec supports that, so it should work in both RSpec and MiniTest,
and you don't need to switch your other tests to use minitest syntax.
Use them interchangeably, as needed.
```ruby
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.expect_with(:rspec, :minitest)
end
```

And in another file (see `spec/rots/mocks/integration_spec.rb` for more):

```ruby
RSpec.describe("openid") do
  subject(:app) { Rots::Mocks::ClientApp.new(**options) }

  let(:options) { {identifier: "#{Rots::Mocks::RotsServer::SERVER_URL}/john.doe?openid.success=true"} }

  it "with_get" do
    mock_openid_request(app, "/", method: "GET")
    follow_openid_redirect!(app)

    assert_equal 200, @response.status
    assert_equal "GET", @response.headers["X-Method"]
    assert_equal "/", @response.headers["X-Path"]
    assert_equal "success", @response.body
  end
end
```

### Note about the deprecation of stdlib gems `logger`, `rexml`, `stringio`, `net-http`, and `uri`

They will not be direct dependencies until the situation with bundler is resolved.
You will need to add them directly to downstream tools.

See [this discussion](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues/7178#issuecomment-2372558363) for more information.

## How does it work?

When you install the `rots` gem, a binary also called `rots` is provided for starting the server (for more
info about what options you have when executing this file, check the -h option).

By default, rots will have a test user called "John Doe", with an OpenID identity "john.doe".
If you want to use your own test user name, you can specify a config file to rots. The
default configuration file looks like this:

### Default configuration file
```yaml
identity: john.doe
sreg:
  nickname: jdoe
  fullname: John Doe
  email: jhon@doe.com
  dob: 1985-09-21
  gender: M
```

You can specify a new config file using the option `--config`.

## Getting Started

The best way to get started, is running the rots server, and then starting to execute your OpenID consumer tests/specs. You just have to specify the identity url of your test user, if you want the OpenID response be successful just add the openid.success=true flag to the user identity url. If you don't specify the flag it
will return a cancel response instead.

Example:
```ruby
it "should authenticate with OpenID" do
  post("/consumer_openid_login", "identity_url" => "http://localhost:1132/john.doe?openid.success=true")
end
```
